with 'lspci | egrep -i --color 'network|ethernet' you can find out what chipset you have 
(I have broadcom BCM43228)

you need to install the STA broacom drivers (closed source)
there are some on the ubuntu installation disk

first install dkms
cd /cdrom/pool/main/d/dkms
sudo dpkg -i dkms*

then patch
cd /cdrom/pool/main/p/patch
sudo dpkg -i patch*

then fakeroot\cd /cdrom/pool/main/f/fakeroot
sudo dpkg -i fakeroot*

now the bcmwl driver
cd /cdrom/pool/restricted/b/bcmwl
sudo dpkg -i bcmwl-kernel-source*

it's possible that this last one gives you an error like this
"ERROR (dkms apport): kernel package linux-headers-3.16.0-30-generic is not supported"
this means that you're kernel is too new for the bcmwl driver and you need to download the latest version from the ubuntu repository.
You'll probably need the 64 bit version (but check with uname -m)
